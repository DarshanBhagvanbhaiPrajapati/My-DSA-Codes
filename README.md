# Data Structures and Algorithms Repository

This repository contains the implementations of essential data structures and algorithms 
that I have learned and practiced. It serves as a comprehensive collection to strengthen 
problem-solving skills and prepare for coding interviews and competitive programming.

## Included Topics:
- **Arrays**: Basic operations, searching, and manipulation.
- **Strings**: String handling and pattern matching.
- **Linked Lists**: Singly, doubly, and circular lists with standard operations.
- **Trees**: Binary trees, traversals, and binary search trees.
- **Graphs**: 
- **Sorting Algorithms**: 
- **Stacks and Queues**: Standard operations and applications.
- **Recursion**: Backtracking and classic problems.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Optimization techniques.

This repository is a valuable resource for understanding and implementing the
foundations of data structures and algorithms.
